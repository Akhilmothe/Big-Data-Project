# Big-Data-Project
Objective: The main goal of this project is to develop a predictive model using linear regression for forecasting taxi fares in upcoming rides. By utilizing historical taxi ride data, our primary emphasis is on training and validating the predictive model to improve accuracy and reliability.

Data Utilization: We will harness historical taxi ride data to train and validate our predictive model.

Data Source: Our dataset comprises detailed taxi trip records, utilizing historical data from 2023 with a size of 2.5 GB. Key columns include:
Pick-Up and Drop-Off Locations
Trip Distance
Passenger Count
Payment Type
